# Happy-Birthday-Python-Greeter
This program is to say Happy Birthday to anyone.

Say happy birthday to yourself, friends and anyone. The code is not messy.

It even titles and strips the name for you.

Why make software? Why not charge people for using it? But instead make it free

I genuinely believe EVERYONE that includes people that do not know programming should have access to these programs to do goods for them, telling them something to many more things, and i also believe everyone has a right to open source software.

codeversion is the place to share versions of original code
